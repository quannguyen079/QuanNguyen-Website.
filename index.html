        <p class="lead mb-4">I have some successes and many missteps that Iâ€™m a little regretful about because I think should have done better. For this quarter, I believe that I have a lot of different things I can talk about because of how my life was kind of mess up because of my unusual schedule. Because I have to work every day except Saturday and Sunday, so I was trying to make time for both my study and work. But because I didnâ€™t plan to work when I registered for the class in the fall. So I registered for classes to spread out from Monday to Friday which makes limits my work time and I have to travel a lot from my house to my workplace. But luckily, because I was working for my aunt so she really understands my situation, and allow me to leave when I have a class.<br><br>

         I regret that I want the money so much that I work a lot. And when I work a lot, I didnâ€™t have time to study and time to take care of myself. Also because of working, I didnâ€™t take care of myself. I set the goal to run early every morning, but I rarely step out of my bed because I always stay up late to finish my work and playing at night. And I think that because of this sleeping habit, it makes me feel always tired, and having anxiety about whatever I do. I have set many goals for myself in both academic and personal life at the beginning of the quarter. My first goal when the quarter begins is to do well in all of my classes include English class, War and Rebellion class, Chass class, and Ethnicity Class. I did try to study when I get home after work in order to achieve the goals, however, I always kinda tired when I get home so the time I spend on studying is not very productive and effective.<br><br>

         Now that I have saved kind of enough money, I think that in the winter quarter, I will work less and spend more time studying and also spending more time with my family because I kinda neglect them over these few months. So now I will talk about my successes, I have made enough money to buy myself a small car. Although it is a cheap honda civic, Iâ€™m very proud of myself for being about to buy something on my own because all these years my mother has been working really hard to provide for us and now I prove that Iâ€™m also capable of making money. Iâ€™m glad that I can make my own money and I can help my mother a little bit with our spending. For this winter, I will try to register for all my classes on two days of the week which meant that I will have to come to class on Monday and Tuesday for example. And then I can work from Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. I will be doing the study each night but I will try to finish all the major work on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. I also plan to have to fix a sleep schedule that I can follow.
