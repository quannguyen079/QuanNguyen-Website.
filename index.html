        <p class="lead mb-4">The first meeting for office hours is when I went to professor Alejandra Dubcovsky in week 3 or 4 I believe. She is the professor for my War and Rebellion history class that I took this quarter. The meeting was right after class on Wednesday when we had face to face discussions. Before the meeting I planned to ask her about how to write effecient when analyzing history because we have to do a TQE on Slack and do a summary about the source ‚Äúguale rebellion‚Äù, which is the rebellion of the native americans against early colonist Spaniard. So in the meeting I just ask general study tips like how to read and analyze a primary source and how we can believe what the source is saying is the truth or not. Also I ask her to look over my response to see if it was satisfactory or not. Her answer was in order to read critically you have to answer the question: When, Who, What, Why, How and also try to annotate the reading while you read so that you can review it again. She also said that I should take note of her lecture because it will help with how to analyze history sources and it will help when I review for tests or quiz.With the biased possibility of the sources, she said that‚Äôs why we have to consider many other forms of sources from different perspectives. For example, we have to consider both sides of the Rebellion, which is the Spaniard and Indiginous people. Then she was talking about how oral history plays an important role in telling the story, so she didn‚Äôt have time to look over my response because other students were waiting. I think that the meeting is helpful to me because of her tips for reading because usually when I read I didn‚Äôt annotate the reading. I think that whether students have a question or not they should go to the office hours because the professor is very nice and talking with her can help them learn new things about. So my second office hour meeting was with my English 4 professor Dr. Christine Smedley and it was yesterday. Yesterday was the last day to turn in my Essay for the class, so I planned to come and ask her to help fix some wording and grammar problems in my writing because in the first essay I did make a lot of mistakes. I received a C- high fail in my first essay and there is an option for me to revise and get a better score so I want to ask her about it first. In the meeting, I and the professor talked about how grammar is a big issue in this essay. The amount of verb tense and other errors prevent it from being considered proficient writing. And she recommended that I need to work on some of these grammar problems in online grammar sites and that I should take my essay to the ARC for tutoring or to her during office hours. She also said that this is unnormal for them to place me in English 4 with these much grammar and she suggested that she can talk to her director and change my class to English 3 to help me spend more time on fixing grammar mistakes. And then we don‚Äôt have enough time to talk about my essay 2. So I think that office hours are very beneficial for students because they can get meaningful feedback from their professor. Also they can get many suggestions about study strategies and many other problems.
I have some successes and many missteps that I‚Äôm a little regretful about because I think should have done better. For this quarter, I believe that I have a lot of different things I can talk about because of how my life was kind of mess up because of my unusual schedule. Because I have to work every day except Saturday and Sunday, so I was trying to make time for both my study and work. But because I didn‚Äôt plan to work when I registered for the class in the fall. So I registered for classes to spread out from Monday to Friday which makes limits my work time and I have to travel a lot from my house to my workplace. But luckily, because I was working for my aunt so she really understands my situation, and allow me to leave when I have a class.<br><br>

         I regret that I want the money so much that I work a lot. And when I work a lot, I didn‚Äôt have time to study and time to take care of myself. Also because of working, I didn‚Äôt take care of myself. I set the goal to run early every morning, but I rarely step out of my bed because I always stay up late to finish my work and playing at night. And I think that because of this sleeping habit, it makes me feel always tired, and having anxiety about whatever I do. I have set many goals for myself in both academic and personal life at the beginning of the quarter. My first goal when the quarter begins is to do well in all of my classes include English class, War and Rebellion class, Chass class, and Ethnicity Class. I did try to study when I get home after work in order to achieve the goals, however, I always kinda tired when I get home so the time I spend on studying is not very productive and effective.<br><br>

         Now that I have saved kind of enough money, I think that in the winter quarter, I will work less and spend more time studying and also spending more time with my family because I kinda neglect them over these few months. So now I will talk about my successes, I have made enough money to buy myself a small car. Although it is a cheap honda civic, I‚Äôm very proud of myself for being about to buy something on my own because all these years my mother has been working really hard to provide for us and now I prove that I‚Äôm also capable of making money. I‚Äôm glad that I can make my own money and I can help my mother a little bit with our spending. For this winter, I will try to register for all my classes on two days of the week which meant that I will have to come to class on Monday and Tuesday for example. And then I can work from Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. I will be doing the study each night but I will try to finish all the major work on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. I also plan to have to fix a sleep schedule that I can follow. So I think that I will plan to sleep at 11:30 pm and wake up at 7:30 then I will run for about 30 minutes when I wake up for my exercise because I didn‚Äôt do anything exercise for the fall quarter so far. So I want to do it for the sake of my physical health and my mind as well because I read online that spending running in the park really help people to refresh their mind and help them to be more productive overall. I also plan to eat healthy food and stop eating junk food at night because it‚Äôs not good for my body. I to cook with my mother in the morning and maybe we can cook something healthy for the whole family. And then I should spend more time with my family like eating dinner with them or just spending the weekend to watch a movie or do something fun. So that is, this is all my plan for the winter quarter, I don‚Äôt know if I gonna be able to do it or not, but I will try my best. So now I will be talking about the remote learning environment because of the covid 19. So I think that a remote learning environment is kinda convenient for me because I can be anywhere and still able to learn. Although there are a lot of distractions around my workplace, I think I can still able to get something out of the class. However, I think this is not the best way to learn in college because I feel like it‚Äôs lack of human interaction in many ways. I would prefer the normal learning environment to get the best out of the classes. But due to the situation with covid 19, I think that safety is the most important thing for every one of us. Up until week 9, I feel worry that I won‚Äôt be able to pass my English 4 class because I have a 70% currently and I hear the final is really hard. I also worry about doing a research paper for my history class because I never did it before I‚Äôm not sure if I writing a good paper. But I think I will try my best to complete the finals. Also, I want to thank Angelica and G for providing me with a lot of useful resources and you guys were always nice to me even I miss a lot of the work for the class.
